title: Hello, World! Welcome to IR Codes!
---
This blog is brought to you in part by Barry Clark's jekyll-now project on GitHub, Jekyll, and GitHub Pages. Thank you all for these wonderful tools. This post is left here as a homage to how easy it is to spin up a developer-friendly markdown-based blog hosted for free and little to no command line intervention. Cheers!

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
